# Skill Catalog

Complete catalog of every skill domain the bootstrapper can generate. Each entry describes what it covers, when it's needed, and the minimum content it must contain.

This catalog is **tech-stack agnostic** — adapt every skill to the project's actual language, framework, and infrastructure choices.

## Skill Composition Rules

1. **No overlap**: If two skills cover the same topic, assign ownership to ONE skill, cross-reference from the other
2. **Consistent terminology**: All skills must use the same terms for the same concepts
3. **Consistent tech references**: If one skill says "use Zod", every skill mentioning validation references Zod
4. **Project-specific**: Every skill references actual project names, paths, tech versions
5. **Layered authority**: `project-architecture` decisions override individual skill preferences
6. **Version pinning**: All skills reference the same dependency versions
7. **Error format**: All skills use the same error shape and codes
8. **Logging format**: All skills use the same structured log format
